# odin-recipes
This project will feature a webpage filled with recipes of my favorite dishes. I'll be using HTML to build this webpage. So far I've learnt how to insert text with different sizes and styles like bold and italic, as well as the differences between absolute and relative links and linking webpages and pictures in these webpages, and resizing them accordingly.
